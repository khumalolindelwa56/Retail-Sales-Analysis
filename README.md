This project focuses on analyzing daily aggregated sales data for a single retail product to identify key performance metrics and patterns that can guide better pricing and promotional decisions. The problem is the analysis want to solve is determining which products contributing most (or least) to overall profitability. Measuring Performance inability to easily generate and track key performance indicators (KPIs) like Year-over-Year growth and rolling averages without manual, time-consuming data pulls.

Examine sales and profit trends over time to uncover seasonal or day-of-week patterns. Evaluate the impact of pricing and promotions on sales volume and profitability.

Determine daily sales price per unit, average unit sales price, daily gross profit, and gross profit per unit using SQL and Python.
Analyze how performance changes across days, weeks, and months to highlight high-performing periods.
Assess how discounts or price changes influence quantity sold and overall profitability.

# Tools used to implement the project
SQL- Used for data storage, querying, and calculation of key performance metrics such as sales price per unit, gross profit, and profit margins.
Snowflake- Used for scalable data exploration, SQL-based transformations, and generating weekday insights using date functions.
Python- pandas used for data cleaning, computation, and creating visualizations such as trend lines, profit comparisons, and summary charts. 
Microsoft Excel- Used to create Pivot Tables and interactive dashboards to visualize sales and profit performance.    
PowerPoint- Used to document, visualize, and explain analytical steps in an interactive format.
Github- Used for version control and collaboration, storing all project scripts, SQL queries, and documentation.

# Summary of results
After data is analyzed it is experted to deliver a clear understanding on how sales, customers, inventory and marketing activities impact the overall performance of the business. Identification of the best-selling and lease performing products, categories and time slots.

# Retail-Sales-Analysis
This project presents a sales analysis of retail transactional data, executed entirely within a SQL database environment.

# Problem statement
Retail businesses generate large volumes of sales data every day, but without proper analysis, valuable insights into pricing, profitability, and customer behavior remain hidden.
This project focuses on analyzing daily aggregated sales data for a single retail product to identify key performance metrics and patterns that can guide better pricing and promotional decisions. The problem is the analysis want to solve is determining which products contributing most (or least) to overall profitability. Measuring Performance inability to easily generate and track key performance indicators (KPIs) like Year-over-Year growth and rolling averages without manual, time-consuming data pulls.

# Aim
The aim of this project is to analyze daily retail sales data to measure performance, identify profitability trends, and generate actionable insights that support data-driven business decisions. Compute key sales metrics such as daily sales price per unit, average unit sales price, daily gross profit, and gross profit per unit. Examine sales and profit trends over time to uncover seasonal or day-of-week patterns. Evaluate the impact of pricing and promotions on sales volume and profitability.

# Objectives
Determine daily sales price per unit, average unit sales price, daily gross profit, and gross profit per unit using SQL and Python.
Analyze how performance changes across days, weeks, and months to highlight high-performing periods.
Assess how discounts or price changes influence quantity sold and overall profitability.

# Tools used to implement the project
SQL- Used for data storage, querying, and calculation of key performance metrics such as sales price per unit, gross profit, and profit margins.
Snowflake- Used for scalable data exploration, SQL-based transformations, and generating weekday insights using date functions.
Python- pandas used for data cleaning, computation, and creating visualizations such as trend lines, profit comparisons, and summary charts. 
Microsoft Excel- Used to create Pivot Tables and interactive dashboards to visualize sales and profit performance.    
PowerPoint- Used to document, visualize, and explain analytical steps in an interactive format.
Github- Used for version control and collaboration, storing all project scripts, SQL queries, and documentation.
